getpeercon_server: A Simple SELinux Development and Test Tool
===============================================================================
https://github.com/pcmoore/getpeercon_server

A simple tool to help with SELinux development.  This tool was originally
created to help with labeled networking development on IPv4, but it has since
grown to support IPv6 as well as UNIX domain sockets.  It has also found
limited use as a SELinux policy demonstrator for training purposes.

A brief warning that the code is a bit crude, but it is functional and well
behaved.
